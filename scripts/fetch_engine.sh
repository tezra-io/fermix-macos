# Deliberately thin, and deliberately separate from scripts/verify_engine.sh:
# this half is the one that needs the network and a GitHub token, and the half
# that decides whether what arrived may be shipped needs neither. Split that
# way, every refusal that matters is provable offline against fixtures
# (scripts/verify_engine_test.sh) instead of only during a release.
#
# Nothing here is verified. A file in the download directory has no standing
# until verify_engine.sh has checked it against engine/PIN.json.

# Usage: fetch_engine.sh <pin.json> <download-dir>
#   <pin.json>      the engine pin, normally engine/PIN.json
#   <download-dir>  created if absent, required to be empty: a stale asset left
#                   over from an earlier run is an asset nobody pinned
#
# Downloads, per target, the tarball and its .sha256, .sig and .pem sidecars.
# The .sha256 is the release's own record and travels with the asset for the
# release log; the digest that decides anything is the one in the pin.
