# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report privately by email to **[security@tezra.io](mailto:security@tezra.io)**.
The same address covers every Fermix repository.

Please include:

- a description of the issue and its impact,
- steps to reproduce (or a proof of concept),
- the affected version / commit, and
- any suggested remediation.

We aim to acknowledge reports within a few days and will coordinate a fix and
disclosure timeline with you. Never include real secrets (API keys, tokens) in
a report — redact them.

## Supported versions

Security fixes ship in the next app release, which installed apps are offered
as an update. Always run the latest release. The app runs the engine release
it pins, so an engine fix reaches Mac users with the app release that pins it.

## Scope

The Fermix macOS app installs, runs, updates and manages the Fermix engine on
a Mac.

For the Fermix engine's own boundary (secret handling, the sandbox, channel
ingress, signed upgrades), see the [Fermix security policy](https://github.com/tezra-io/fermix/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
